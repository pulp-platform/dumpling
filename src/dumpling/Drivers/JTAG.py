class JTAGDriver:
    """
    The `JTAGDriver` class provides convenience functions to interact with a specific JTAG chain.

    The driver instance requires a `VectorBuilder` instance in order generate vector in the required format.

    The JTAGDriver expects the VectorBuilder to contain pin declarations with the following *logical name* (the
    physical name is not relevant for the driver):

    - 'tck': The jtag clock pin
    - 'trst': The test logic reset pin
    - 'tms': The test mode select pin
    - 'tdi': The test data in pin
    - 'tdo': The test data out pin

    For the tck, tms, trst and tms pins the driver will write vectors containing the '0' and '1' on state character to
    denote application of logic low and logic high (or no-clk and clk in the case of TCK). The state character for the
    tdo pin can either be '0' for sampling and comparison with logic low, '1' for sampling and comparison with logic
    high or 'X' if the output of TDO should be 'don't care' for the current vector.

    After instantiation of the driver, the JTAG chain configuration needs to be configured by adding JTAGTap
    instances in the order they are hooked up the JTAG chain. This enables the JTAGDriver class and the JTAGTap
    instances that interact with this driver to provide high-level functions for JTAG interaction without needing to
    now the number of additional TAPs on the same chain.

    E.g.::

       driver = JTAGDriver(my_vector_builder)
       riscv_debug_tap = RISCVDebugTap(driver)
       driver.add_tap(risc_debug_tap)
       driver.add_tap(JTAGTap(ir_size=5, driver=driver)) #Add some dummy tap

       #Start using the taps or the driver driver directly
       vectors = risc_debug_tap.halt_harts(...)
       vectors += driver.jtag_set_dr(...)
       writer.write_vectors(vectors)

    For TAPs that we don't need to interact with you can just add instantiations of the `JTAGTap` base class as a dummy
    tap to make sure the driver accounts for the additional flip-flops in the chains IR and DR path. Unless otherwise
    stated, the high-level functions provided by the individual taps will always select the BYPASS register for all
    other taps except the one that should be currently used.
