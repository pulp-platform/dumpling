class CocotbVectorDriver:
    """
    A class to simulate the application of vectors with
    an RTL simulator.

    The class mimics the behavior of the ASIC tester's wave table. It provides cocotb coroutines that apply the given
    vectors to a device under test. It addition to the dut handle to which the vectors are applied that constructor also
    expects the pins declaration corresponding to the vectors according to the format specified in `VectorBuilder`
    docstring. There is however one additional key that needs to be provided for each pin:

    The CocotbDriver expects the pinlist 'pins' to contain a wavefun key for each pin with an associated coroutine
    function that will be used to apply values to the signal or sample them. This allows to mimick the behavior of the
    ASIC tester wavetable by arbitrary shifting the time were data is applied or sampled.

    Each wavefunction is supposed to have the signature like the following example wavefunction::

       async def my_stimuli_appl_fun(signal, value):
         await cocotb.trigger.Timer('2', units='ns') #Wait 2ns
         signal <= value

    signals is a CocoTB simulation object handle (a signal handle) and value is the pin state character of the pin
    for the current vector.
    The example wavefunction from above will advance simulation time by 2ns before applying the value to the signals.

    The CocotbVectorDriver will fork the supplied coroutine for each pin supplying the cocotb pin signal handle to
    'signal' and the value of the current vector to 'value' as arguments to the coroutine function. After all
    wavefunction coroutines have terminated, the driver proceeds with applying the next vectors. It is good practice to
    have all wavefunctions associated with each pin consume the same amount of simulated time (i.e. the period of the
    device cycle on the ASIC tester)

    The CocotbDriver class contains static helper functions to generate wavefunction coroutines for commonly used
    wavetable schemes ('simple_clock_gen_wavefun', 'simple_stimuli_appl_wavefun' and 'simple_response_acq_wavefun').

    Args:
        pins: The pins description dictionary as described in the Docstring of VectorWriter.
        dut: The cocotb design under thest simulation handle i.e. the toplevel module where stimuli should be applied to.

        - Documentation of the apply_vector method.
